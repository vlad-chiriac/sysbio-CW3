Files I used for my coursework.

The niche.r and niche.nlogo files are unedited, as they were given to us. The rest are modified to suit my needs. Many thanks to Stan, Veronica and Pete for helping me along the way.

You will need to install grind.R from this link https://tbb.bio.uu.nl/rdb/grindR.html and its dependencies.
